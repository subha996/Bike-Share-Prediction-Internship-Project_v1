# üìù Description

The Project is about to build a system where the client can predict Expected customers for a day, based on the weather condition at the place of the Client Store and date information. From the system, the client can fill in some weather information like temperature, wind speed, e.tc. and date information like month, season e.t.c. And the system itself should be able to give the number of expected customers for that particular day. The system is designed in such a way that if the user did not fill in any information by himself, then the system will capture all necessary information by itself and produce the result.  From this information, users can decide their business plan, that how many customers will appear on that particular day, so they can arrange the other needs that are provided for their business.
